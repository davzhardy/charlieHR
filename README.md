# charlieHR Assessment

Refactored original Ruby assessment to JavaScript.

Completed age and next_birthday methods as required in the assessment.

Note: this repo uses a simple test suite which replicates the original test requirements . A more complete set of tests using a framework such as Jest could be implemented, but this was considered out of scope for this exercise.
